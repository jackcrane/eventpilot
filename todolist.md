# Todo list

This is a list of todos and the issues I currently have with the code I have written

- [ ] Fix the loading/null state of todo cards when they get dragged to a different stage. I think this can be done by pulling everything into a higher state that gets provided down.
- [ ] Fix input spacing in todo details page
- [ ] Fix the todo details page's todo card's badge from overflowing outside of the header
- [ ] Make dropdown input have a max height and scroll when it overflows
- [ ] Make dropdown input automatically focus searchboar when it is opened
- [ ] Make dropdown input open when user tabs to it and clicks space or enter
- [ ] Fix toasts not working???
- [ ] Fix "todo modified" and "todo stage modified" log duplication
- [ ] Figure out why fetchTodo is being called like 8 billion times
- [ ] Pull out the fetchTodo calls into a higher state to prevent re-fetching
- [ ] Change the top of the sticky explanation section on the marketing and legal pages so the top doesnt get cut off by the header.
